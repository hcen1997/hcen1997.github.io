In year 2020, ebooks can replace most function of 
printed books.  
Printed books are fast, stable, unforgettable.  
Ebooks are lightweight, shareable, cheap.  
**BOTH CAN LEARN INFORMATION**  
So this is a storage question.

## Rule
Rule 1: All books have a digital copy.  
Rule 2: Only important book will be printed.  

### printed book list
1. The Art of Computer Programing
2. Code Complete
3. The Emperor's New Mind
4. Hackers & Painters
5. The Tao of Programming


### about storage
For noob like me, forget things happened all the time.  
Print out is a way to not forget so as statue, home decoration.
Books in shelf remained me who I am and what should I do.
the shelf has **limited** space.
Keep stay alarm for peaking book which stay in shelf.

### about speed
Printed books are really fast.
You can look up menu and brows information by 
random access. A same performance computer is way
expensive for single book, and people can't read
books to match the cost.   
The speed is critical in thinking. Brain must be 
running even in sub task like changing page or looking
up menu. If any delay happened, people will think 
other stuff, and quiet working.

### about value
Printed books are very important, thus must have 
very high value.  
**Don't be Locked**  
There are processed to one's mind then show 
productivity.
People are week to read multiple books one time.
So stay happy and read book when ever you can.
Don't push yourself too hard.
